# Game-Leader-board-Backend
This project temporarily named Free For You (deserves a better name) was created as a part of an ongoing deal with a new startup in Bengaluru, India. The idea was to create a game which where the highest scorer of the day will get a meal coupon from partner restaurants. The game was supposed to be a simple one as the main attraction of the game would be to be the winner. The game was Celestial Chase (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kartik.celestialchase), a space themed arcade game. 

This project consists of server side scripts which would help a player register his mobile number, name etc onto our database. Logic for duplicate registration was also built. The daily score of the player is tracked and the top ten scorers of the day are shown on a leaderboard on the client device at all times whenever one wishes to see the top scorers of the day. 

The index.html is used to simulate users registering and scoring.

The deal failed and thus this project never saw light of the day. But this was a nice way for me to learn PHP scripting and DB with hands on practice. This is my first attempt at PHP scripting.

One of the features left to code was sending an SMS to the winner the coupon code for a particular restaurant. I have not tested this with a larger player base. I am sure there would be issues to deal with then.
